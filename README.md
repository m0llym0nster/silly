I really don't understand why in 2025 people feel the need to provide a 100+ page binder of command instructions of commands they pulled from the internet when they could make a script with some comments. I got a lot of these commands from the vendor sites and mashed them together with other stuff to make life a little easier than opening and copy/pasting one at a time from separate files.
